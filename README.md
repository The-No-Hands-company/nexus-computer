# Nexus.computer

Nexus is a privacy-first personal cloud computer for The No Hands Company.
It is built to feel like a calm, powerful, production-grade alternative to the Zo computer experience:
free as in freedom, open source, private by default, and never paywalled.

## What it does

- Chat with an AI agent that can run shell commands
- Create, read, write, and delete files in a persistent workspace
- Build tools, scripts, and services inside your own cloud computer
- Stream results live in a terminal-style interface

## Philosophy

- No subscriptions
- No ads
- No tracking
- No paywalls
- No surveillance
- Free software, forever
- Private by default

## Stack

- Backend: FastAPI + Anthropic SDK
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Deployment: Railway-ready single service

## Production features

- Streaming agent chat
- Workspace file explorer
- Safe workspace path handling
- Security headers
- Health and metadata endpoints
- Persistent workspace volume support

## Run locally

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key uvicorn main:app --reload
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for deployment

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Then run the Python app with the built frontend available under `frontend/dist`.
